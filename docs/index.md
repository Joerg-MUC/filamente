# Filament for 3d printing

using differnt filaments on multiple 3d printers needs changes to the slicing parameters to secure optimal printing.

In general there are main setting based on
* printer
    * nozle diameter
    * printing speed
* material type
* material vendor

And yes, details can change if you get different charges of the same material. So a slidly adaption needs to be done for each spool.
